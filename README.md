geotechnically_write

Geotechnically Write is a program to help create a base line geotechnical report minus engineering and geologic analysis. It is meant to pull information from a file created during data entry from software called Gint used for boring log creation, and from text input, and button selections from the user. 

The excel file from Gint needs to be named "Geo.xlsx", and a base report must be provided named "base_geotech_report.docx"

A base geotechnical report can be requested from chris.kightlinger@gmail.com

Any files produced from this should be reviewed by a professional and should not be considered as accurate or reliable.
